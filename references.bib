Gerontechnology 2016;14(3):127-138; doi:10.4017/gt.2016.14.3.002.00 Researchers have recognized the potential of digital games to facilitate intergenerational connections and learning in diverse contexts. To understand the extent to which digital games can be considered as powerful tools for connecting different generations, this study reviewed nineteen published intergenerational interventions supported by digital games. Collectively, these studies highlight some features of intergenerational play such as short duration, flexibility, the new roles of young and older people, and the importance of intermediary generations on supporting intergenerational play. This study also reviewed seven games specifically designed for intergenerational play. A number of design ideas have emerged from reviewing these games, but the most important design consideration is emphasizing relationship formation. Previous empirical studies have shown significant effects of intergenerational play on positive perceptions towards the other age group. Finally, a number of recommendations are given for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on a longitudinal study that investigates the effects of video-game play on intergenerational perceptions amongst youths and the elderly after participating in a program involving regular interaction sessions over two months. Each pair of participants, consisting of one youth and one elderly, was randomly assigned to either the video-game condition (n = 38, 19 from each age group) or the non-video-game condition (n = 36, 18 each). Attraction, intergroup anxiety, attitudes, and game enjoyment were measured through pre-test and post-test surveys to investigate changes in perceptions. Results showed that participants in the video-game condition reported more positive changes in intergroup anxiety and attitudes, compared to participants in the non-video-game condition. Mediation analyses showed that speciﬁc attraction towards their interaction partner mediated the effects of video-game play on attitudes and intergroup anxiety towards the general members of the other age group. In addition, the results showed that game enjoyment played an important role in developing positive intergenerational perceptions only for the elderly, but not for the youth participants in the video-game condition. We discuss implications with respect to options to enhance intergenerational perceptions and communication for youth and elderly cohorts in today’s hyper-ageing society.},

The game supports both a single-player and a multiplayer mode, in which the elderly can play with their friends or family using an embedded video chat application. The main question that is addressed in this paper is how the elderly gamers’ experience is inﬂuenced by the possibility to communicate directly with the other players. The study presents a comparison of the game experience and appreciation of older users and their (grand)children playing the game together, with or without the video chat application. Most importantly, the study shows that the added value of video chat is not limited to social contact, but that it also provides opportunities for the younger generation to assist the elderly during the game. In conclusion, the paper points out some intergenerational game design implications, and some future research suggestions.},

A large body of research exists showing that the effects of these games are much broader. In fact, some types of commercial games have been proven to enhance basic perceptual and cognitive skills. These effects are significant enough that educators use these games for such practical, real-world purposes as training surgeons and rehabilitating individuals with perceptual or cognitive deficits. Although many individuals may still consider video games nothing more than mindless fun, the authors argue that games serve also as serious tools for good.},

However research has highlighted a need for shared activities for long-distance family communication. While video technology is reportedly superior to audio-only tools for children under age 7, the tools themselves are not designed to accommodate children's or families' needs. This paper introduces four design explorations of shared play activities over video conferencing that support family togetherness between children and remote adult family members. We build on research in {CSCW} and child development to create opportunities for silliness and open-ended play between adults and young children. Our goal is to scaffold interaction across distance and generations.},

We conducted a systematic in Scopus, Web of Science, {PsicInfo}, Pubmed and Science Direct, finally including 16 empirical studies written in English. The identified benefits were found to fall into four main categories, i.e., (1) reinforcing family bond, (2) enhancing reciprocal learning (3) increasing understanding of the other generation and (4) reducing social anxiety. According to the literature, two types of factors are important to take into consideration: player-centric and game-centric factors. We identified the nature of the interactions between older (55–81 year-olds) and younger players (4–22 year-olds), their motivations to play digital games and the difference in abilities as the main player-centric factors to take into account when designing intergenerational games. The most relevant game-centric factors were found to be goal-related and space-related forms of interaction. To gain more insight into how specific benefits of playing digital games are related to a type of game, gender or age of the participant, additional empirical studies (comparative analyses), that take these factors into account are needed.},

It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet Protocol ({IP}) address and port number that the {NAT} has allocated for the application's User Datagram Protocol ({UDP}) flows to remote hosts. The protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server ({STUN} server) located on the opposing (public) side of the {NAT}, usually the public Internet.
Originally, {STUN} was an acronym for Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol ({UDP}) through Network Address Translators, but this title was changed in a specification of an updated set of methods published as {RFC} 5389, retaining the same acronym.},

However, recent findings suggest that seniors have negative perceptions about mediated co-play over the Internet. Since no empirical results are available for senior gamers, we studied seniors' player experience in three play configurations with increasing levels of social presence: virtual, mediated, and co-located co-play. Results showed that – in contrast to young adults – the increase in a positive player experience as a result from the presence of social elements does not entirely hold for senior gamers. Online co-play is experienced as least enjoyable and seniors' sense of social presence is not affected when a computer controlled co-player is substituted by a distant human co-player.},

	abstract = {Video chat may allow young children and grandparents to develop and maintain bonds when they are physically separated because it enables them to share experiences with each other in real time. We used an ecological model framework to examine factors associated with the development of the grandparent–grandchild relationship during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, when many families were experiencing reduced opportunities for in-person interaction. We analyzed survey data from grandparents (N = 855) and parents (N = 846) of children ages 0–5 years. Predictor variables included participant characteristics (age and education level), proximity variables (geographical distance and whether grandparents had met their grandchildren in person), as well as video chat-specific factors (e.g., frequency of video chats, activities used during video chats). The frequency of video chat and the variety of behaviors engaged in during the video chats predicted grandparents' feelings of closeness to their grandchild as well as grandparents' and parents' enjoyment of family video chats. These predictors were statistically significant after controlling for participant characteristics and physical proximity, suggesting that when families are separated (e.g., due to pandemics, deployment, geographic distance, etc.) family video chats may help to build and maintain grandparent–grandchild connections in an enjoyable way. One future implication is that family video chat may introduce children to the connection between screen and world, a supportive first step in understanding and using technology.},
